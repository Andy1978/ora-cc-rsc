Open Roberta Lab Crosscompiler Resources
========================================

This repository contains the resources needed by the crosscompilers used by the Open Roberta Lab.
For details please read the 'README.md' from the repository '[openroberta-lab](https://github.com/OpenRoberta/openroberta-lab)'.

When using these resources, make sure to build them using `mvn clean install`. This pulls some necessary resources for EV3 leJOS and Arduino based robots.
